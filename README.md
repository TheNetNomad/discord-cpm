# Discord iz-cpm Wrapper

Have you ever wanted to run a CP/M program in a Discord server? I think everyone has had this urge once or twice in their life. [iz-cpm] is an awesome emulator allowing you to run CP/M programs in your terminal. Discord iz-cpm Wrapper is a Discord bot that kicks off iz-cpm as a child process and lets you use a Discord channel as your terminal. Just update BOT_CHANNEL_ID, BOT_CLIENT_ID, and PROGRAM_NAME and you're off to the races!

## Disclaimers 
- This project not associated with the creators of iz80 or iz80-cpm
- This is a trimmed-down and cleaned-up version of what I'm running, and some issues may have been introduced in that process. If something doesn't work right for you, let me know as it's likely my fault.
- This was originally written for BBC BASIC and as such prevents quitting that program and returning to the CP/M shell, but other programs may behave differently- use at your own risk.
